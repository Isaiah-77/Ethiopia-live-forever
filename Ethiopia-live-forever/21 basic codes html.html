<p style=" color: blue> There have been fears that the countries could be drawn into a conflict should the dispute not be resolved.</p>

 <br>

<p> In 2013, there were reports of a secret recording showing <strong>Egyptian politicians proposing a range of hostile acts against Ethiopia</strong> over the<b>building </B> of the dam.</p>
	<br>

<p>President Sisi has also been quoted as saying that <em>Egypt would take all the necessary measures to protect their rights</em> to the Nile waters.</p>
<br>
<p> In October last year, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed <u>told MPs that "no force" could stop Ethiopia from building the dam</u></p>

 <p style="font-size:25px;">Ethiopia says Egypt trying to maintain "colonial era" grip over Nile</p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"> A major benefit of the dam will be hydropower production. All the energy generated by GERD will be going into the national grid of Ethiopia to fully support the development of the whole country, both in rural and urban areas.</p>

 <hr>
 <p style="text-align:right;">Egypt was given ownership of the Nile in 1929 by Great Britain. At that time, Britain's powerful military controlled Egypt, and wanted to make sure they also had control of the Nile. Britain no longer rules Egypt, but this treaty (official agreement) still gives Egypt final say over how the river is used today.</p>
